# LLM Learning Journey

Welcome to my 52-week journey to master deep learning and reinforcement learning from first principles. This repo tracks my hands-on curriculum to reach the level of an L1 AI researcher by May 2026.

## 🧭 Goals

- Build, debug, and explain key architectures: MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, transformers, and RL algorithms
- Summarize and critique foundational AI research papers
- Build a real-world portfolio via projects, Kaggle competitions, and open-source contributions
- Track learning progress with rigor, discipline, and curiosity

## ✅ Progress

| Phase        | Focus                         | Status         |
|--------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| Phase 1      | Foundations (Weeks 1–13)      | ✅ In Progress |
| Phase 2      | Architectures (14–26)         | ⏳ Coming Soon |
| Phase 3      | RL + GANs (27–39)             | ⏳ Planned     |
| Phase 4      | Research + Interviews (40–52) | ⏳ Planned     |

## 🌌 Personal Angle

I include astronomy and radio astronomy themes in my projects where possible — from image classification to time-series signal detection.
