# Build an LLM From Scratch #
This is a fun side project in my deep learning journey, where I'm building a language model from scratch while following Sebastian Raschka’s book. I’ll use this as a daily journal to document my learnings and progress along the way. Once I finish the book, I hope to reflect on and summarize my biggest takeaways.
